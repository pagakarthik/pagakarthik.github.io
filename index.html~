"I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don't feel that the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led to it, that you can make it more." Alan J. Perlis (1922-1990)

  <li>Feature based navigation of robots in constrained & unknown terrain

  <li>Obstacle shape estimation by using approximate comcentrations of simple geometric curves

  <li>Single pass (FMM, OUM) and sweeping algorithms for static
  Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs.

  <li>High quality, publically released implementations of these
  algorithms.

  <li>Application of these algorithms to path planning for autonomous
  and semi-autonomous systems.

</ul>

<p>For those interested in experimenting the Point cloud library over ROS for robot perception
 such as, euclidean cluster extarction, object pose estimation, sementation (minicut etc.), I have published:

<h3><a href="https://github.com/pagakarthik/perception_pcl/tree/hydro-devel">The ROS tutorials for real time 3D point cloud processing</a></h3>

<p>I will soon update the wiki for consolidated a pipeline which can ease the simple tasks in robot perception (hobby projects) to identify the object and lablel each in the scene, segmentation, extract features or centroid estimation. These tutorials cover the modules which would form the robot perception tree. Individual explanations have been authored and well documented in their respective tutorials @ http://pointcloud.org. (comments included in respectice source scripts as well) --Happy Robot(ifying)--

<h3>Capstone Project</h3>
<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Mobile robots (smart powered wheelchairs) for indoor navigation offer the possibility of
enhanced mobility to a large and growing population (most notably older adults), and a key
feature of such a chair is obstacle recognition and avoidance. Sensors are required to detect
nearby obstacles; however, complete sensor coverage of the immediate neighborhood is
challenging for reasons including financial, computational, aesthetic, user identity and sensor
reliability. However, direct modeling and control of commercial wheelchairs is not possible
because of proprietary internals and interfaces (standard CANBUS protocols). In this work we
design a dynamic egocentric occupancy map which maintains information about local obstacles
even when they are outside the field of view of the sensor system on the basis of a probabilistic
mapping scheme, thus serving as a task specific module. The end result of the SLAM algorithm
is an egocentric polar occupancy grid map published as a point cloud.
</p>
<p>Keywords: information agglomeration matrix, recursive state
estimation, obstacle detection, map estimation without full sensor coverage, bayes filter
algorithm, markov assumption. </p>

This project extends 
"A risk assessment infrastructure for powered wheelchair motion commands without full sensor coverage" work done by Pouria Talebifard et al.,  presented at <a href="https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/conferences/IROS14/program/IROS14_ContentListWeb_4.html"> IROS 2014, Chicago</a>
