<p><h2>Oxygen Mask With Mic</h2>
			<p><i>Some problems in healthcare which seem obvious are 
						apparently so obvious that they are overlooked! </i>
			</p>

<h5> Problem Description</h5>
							<br/>
							<p>One such issue is the difficulty that a patient experiences while communicating when he
							is on oxygen supply through an oxygen mask.  This project was developed as a part of the 
							Conclave for Innovative Medical Technologies organized by the Consortium of Affordable Medical
							Technologies of the Massachusetts General Hospital. The idea was to develop an affordable, 
							simple and a non-invasive way of addressing this problem statement.
							</p>
<h5 Solution</h5>
						<p>
									Within the next 24 hours, we were able to come up with a solution which was amazingly simple 
							yet effective! What we had done, was effectively pick-up the vibration from the diaphragm of 
							the mask using a piezo and amplify it. The amplified signals were then transmitted to the soda
							can speakers which were integrated with the MIT cap that we received during the pitch session at
							the start of the conclave.

<h5> Awards</h5>

									With our creation and our business plan, we were awarded the
								first prize at the conclave and were covered by some of the major newspapers across the country.</p>

<h2>E.Y.E. (Enhanced The Eye)</h2>
<p>Mentoring team: MIT Media Lab Camera Culture group</p>
<a href="eye_summary.pdf"> [Summary of work.pdf]</a><br>
What?<br>
It is essentially an assistive device for the low visioned people (targeting specifically schoolÂ­going
children and university students). Its structure is like that of a regular safety glass with a camera
fixed in the middle and a beam splitter glass mounted in front of it to act as a screen. The
camera takes in the live feed of the surroundings which is displayed on a laptop screen and is
then transferred to an android device by remote access feature. The user can zoom in and out
of feed by rotating a knob present on the arm of the glasses. Also, other video parameters such
as brightness, contrast, exposure etc can be varied.<br>
Why?<br>
Low vision patients have few options to read at distance. The available devices are annoying,
unaesthetic, heavy and expensive, relying in complex optics mounted on the spectacles or hand
helded (what keeps them away from writing at the same time as reading).<br>
Potential impact<br>
This device meets the need of 246 million people suffering from low vision for a low cost device
to enhance their vision. Huge market scope.
